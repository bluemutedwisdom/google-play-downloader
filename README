IMPORTANT NOTES:

This tool is completely broken as Google has shut down the old API. I won't fix
it anymore. Please move to alternatives like gplaycli [1].

Given you GooglePlay access data and a package name, this script will generate a http
link for you to directly download the APK file to your computer instead of installing
it on your device.

For the help menu please type:

  python gplay-downloader.py --help
